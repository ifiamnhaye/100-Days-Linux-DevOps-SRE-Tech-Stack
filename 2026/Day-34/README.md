# Introduction

## What is an Alias?
An Alias is another name for a command.

Aliases allow Linux Administrators to:

- Create shortcut commands
- Simplify long commands
- Increase productivity
- Reduce typing mistakes
- Improve efficiency

Run:
~~~bash
alias
~~~

What do we see? Instead of typing:

~~~bash
ls -l /root
~~~

you can create an alias:

~~~bash
alias lh='ls -l /root'
~~~

Now simply typing:

~~~bash
lh
~~~

will run:

~~~bash
ls -l /root
~~~

---

# Alias Command Syntax

## General Syntax

~~~bash
alias alias_name='actual_command'
~~~

### Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| alias | Alias command |
| alias_name | New shortcut name |
| actual_command | Real command executed |

---

# Task 1 - View Existing Aliases

## Objective

Display all aliases currently configured.

### Run

~~~bash
alias
~~~

### Questions

1. How many aliases are displayed?
2. Which aliases already exist?
3. Why might Linux create default aliases?

### Notes

Linux distributions often include aliases such as:

~~~bash
alias ll='ls -l'
alias la='ls -a'
alias l='ls -CF'
~~~

---

# Task 2 - Create a Temporary Alias

## Objective

Create an alias that works only in the current session.

### Run

~~~bash
alias lh='ls -l /root'
~~~

### Verify

~~~bash
alias
~~~

### Questions

1. Do you see the alias `lh`?
2. What command does `lh` execute?

---

# Task 3 - Use a Temporary Alias

## Objective

Use the newly created alias.

### Run

~~~bash
lh
~~~

### Expected Result

The contents of:

~~~text
/root
~~~

should be displayed.

### Questions

1. Did the alias work?
2. Was it easier than typing the full command?

---

# Task 4 - Create Additional Temporary Aliases

## Objective

Practice creating multiple aliases.

### Run

~~~bash
alias mydate='date'
alias myuser='whoami'
alias myhost='hostname'
alias myup='uptime'
~~~

### Verify

~~~bash
alias
~~~

### Test Each Alias

~~~bash
mydate
myuser
myhost
myup
~~~

### Questions

1. Which alias was most useful?
2. Which command would you personally create an alias for?

---

# Task 5 - Delete a Temporary Alias

## Objective

Remove an alias from the current session.

### Run

~~~bash
unalias lh
~~~

### Verify

~~~bash
alias
~~~

### Test

~~~bash
lh
~~~

### Expected Result

~~~text
bash: lh: command not found
~~~

### Questions

1. What command removes an alias?
2. What happened when you tried to run `lh` again?

---

# Understanding Temporary Aliases

## Important Note

Temporary aliases:

- Exist only in the current session.
- Are removed automatically when you:
  - Log out
  - Close the terminal
  - Restart the system

---

# Task 6 - Create a Permanent Alias

## Objective

Create an alias that remains available after logout and reboot.

### Step 1 - Open .bashrc

Run

~~~bash
vi ~/.bashrc
~~~

OR

~~~bash
nano ~/.bashrc
~~~

---

### Step 2 - Add the Following Alias

Add this line at the bottom of the file:

~~~bash
alias llroot='ls -l /root'
~~~

Save and exit.

---

### Step 3 - Reload .bashrc

Run

~~~bash
source ~/.bashrc
~~~

---

### Verify

Run

~~~bash
alias
~~~

### Test

~~~bash
llroot
~~~

### Questions

1. Why did we modify `.bashrc`?
2. Why did we run `source ~/.bashrc`?

---

# Task 7 - Verify Permanent Alias

## Objective

Verify that the alias survives future sessions.

### Run

~~~bash
exit
~~~

Log back into the system.

### Verify

~~~bash
alias
~~~

### Test

~~~bash
llroot
~~~

### Questions

1. Did the alias remain available?
2. Why is it called a permanent alias?

---

# Task 8 - Remove a Permanent Alias

## Objective

Delete a permanent alias.

### Step 1 - Open .bashrc

Run

~~~bash
vi ~/.bashrc
~~~

OR

~~~bash
nano ~/.bashrc
~~~

---

### Step 2 - Locate

~~~bash
alias llroot='ls -l /root'
~~~

Delete the line.

---

### Step 3 - Reload Configuration

Run

~~~bash
source ~/.bashrc
~~~

---

### Verify

~~~bash
alias
~~~

### Test

~~~bash
llroot
~~~

### Expected Result

~~~text
command not found
~~~

### Questions

1. Why did the alias disappear?
2. What file stores permanent aliases?

---

# Task 9 - Create Your Own Administrator Aliases

## Objective

Create useful aliases that a Linux Administrator might use daily.

### Examples

~~~bash
alias mylogs='ls -l /var/log'
alias mynet='ip addr'
alias mydisk='df -h'
alias mymem='free -h'
alias myproc='ps -ef'
~~~

### Test

~~~bash
mylogs
mynet
mydisk
mymem
myproc
~~~

### Discussion

Which aliases would make your daily work easier?

# Lab Summary

In this lab you learned how to:

- View existing aliases
- Create temporary aliases
- Use aliases
- Delete temporary aliases
- Create permanent aliases
- Store aliases in `.bashrc`
- Reload shell configuration
- Remove permanent aliases
- Improve efficiency using shortcut commands

---

# Important Lesson

Aliases are one of the easiest ways to become more productive as a Linux Administrator.

Instead of typing long commands repeatedly:

~~~bash
ls -l /var/log
~~~

you can simply create:

~~~bash
alias logs='ls -l /var/log'
~~~

and use:

~~~bash
logs
~~~

This saves time and reduces typing errors.
